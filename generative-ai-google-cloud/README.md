## 1. Introduction to Generative AI

![](./images/ai-vs-ml.png)

- AI is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally
  requiring human intelligence.
- ML (Machine Learning) gives computers the ability to learn without explicit programming.
  - Unsupervised ML models (not labeled)
  - Supervised ML models
  - Reinforcement learning
  - Deep learning, is a subset of ML, using Artificial Neural Networks
    - Generative AI, is a subset of Deep learning
    - Large Language Models (LLMs) are also a subset of Deep learning

- A prompt is a short piece of text that is given to the large language model as input,
  and it can be used to control the output of the model in many ways.
- A foundation model is a large AI model pretrained on a vast quantity of data
  that was "designed to be adapted‚Äù (or fine-tuned) to a wide range of downstream tasks,
  such as sentiment analysis, image captioning, and object recognition.
- Hallucinations are words or phrases that are generated by the model
  that are often *nonsensical or grammatically incorrect*. It can be caused by:
  - The model is not trained on enough data.
  - The model is trained on noisy or dirty data.
  - The model is not given enough context.
  - The model is not given enough constraints.
- Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can create new content,
  such as text, images, audio, and video. It does this by learning from existing data
  and then using that knowledge to generate new and unique outputs.

## 2. Introduction to Large Language Models

- LLMs refer to large general-purpose language models can be pre-trained and then fine-tuned for specific purposes.
- 3 features:
  - Large:
    - Large training dataset
    - Large number of parameters
  - General purpose
    - Commonality of human languages
    - Resource restriction
  - Pre-trained and fine-tuned
- PaLM = Pathways Language Model, released by Google in April 2022.
- benefits for using LLMs:
  1. They can generate human-quality text.
  2. They can be used for many tasks, such as text summarization and code generation.
  3. They can be trained on massive datasets of text and code.
  4. They are constantly improving.
- LLM Development, only need to thinks about prompt design
- Use Cases: Question Answering
- Prompt design is the process of creating prompts that **elicit the desired response** from a language model.

- Prompt Design vs Prompt Engineering
  - Prompt Design: involve instructions and context passed to a language model to achieve a desired task.
    - the process of creating a prompt that is tailored to the specific task that this system is being asked to perform.
  - Prompt Engineering: is the practice of developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models for a variety of applications.
    - the process of creating a prompt that is designed to improve performance.
    - more specialized concept
- 3 kinds of LLM
  - Generatic (Row) Language Models, predict next word based on the language in the training data
  - Instruction Tuned | Trained, predict a response to the instructions given in the point
  - Dialog Tuned | Trained, to have a dialog by predicting the next resoponse.
- Parameter-Efficient Tuning Methods (PETM)

## 3. Introduction to Responsible AI

- AI is not infallible. Developing responsible AI requires an understanding of the possible issues, limitations, or unintended consequences. Technology is a reflection of what exists in society.
- common theme: transparency, fairness, accountability, and privacy
- 7 AI principles from June 2018:
  1. AI should be socially beneficial.
  2. AI should avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias.
  3. AI should be built and tested for safety.
  4. AI should be accountable to people.
  5. AI should incorporate privacy design principles.
  6. AI should uphold high standards of scientific excellence.
  7. AI should be made available for uses that accord with these principles.
